# [Pod] Section

Pod units are named with a `.pod` extension and contain a `[Pod]` section describing
the pod that is created and run as a service. The resulting service file contains a line like
`ExecStartPre=podman pod create …`, and most of the keys in this section control the command-line
options passed to Podman.

By default, the Podman pod has the same name as the unit, but with a `systemd-` prefix, i.e.
a `$name.pod` file creates a `$name-pod.service` unit and a `systemd-$name` Podman pod. The
`PodName` option allows for overriding this default name with a user-provided one.

The generated service defaults to `Restart=on-failure`. Note that with `ExitPolicy=stop` (the
default for Quadlet pods), the pod exits cleanly (exit code 0) when all its containers stop, so
`on-failure` will **not** trigger a restart in that case. To have the pod automatically restart
when containers exit, set `Restart=always` in the `[Service]` section of the `.pod` file.

Valid options for `[Pod]` are listed below:

*Based on [podman-systemd.unit(5)](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html) official documentation.*

### AddHost=

Add host-to-IP mapping to /etc/hosts.
The format is `hostname:ip`.

Equivalent to the Podman `--add-host` option.
This key can be listed multiple times.

### ContainersConfModule=

Load the specified containers.conf(5) module. Equivalent to the Podman `--module` option.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### DNS=

Set network-scoped DNS resolver/nameserver for containers in this pod.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### DNSOption=

Set custom DNS options.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### DNSSearch=

Set custom DNS search domains. Use **DNSSearch=.** to remove the search domain.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### ExitPolicy=

Set the exit policy of the pod when the last container exits. Default for quadlets is **stop**.

To keep the pod active, set `ExitPolicy=continue`.

### GIDMap=

Create the pod in a new user namespace using the supplied GID mapping.
Equivalent to the Podman `--gidmap` option.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### GlobalArgs=

This key contains a list of arguments passed directly between `podman` and `pod`
in the generated file. It can be used to access Podman features otherwise unsupported by the generator. Since the generator is unaware
of what unexpected interactions can be caused by these arguments, it is not recommended to use
this option.

The format of this is a space separated list of arguments, which can optionally be individually
escaped to allow inclusion of whitespace and other control characters.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### HostName=

Set the pod’s hostname inside all containers.

The given hostname is also added to the /etc/hosts file using the container’s primary IP address (also see the `--add-host` option).

Equivalent to the Podman `--hostname` option.

### IP=

Specify a static IPv4 address for the pod, for example **10.88.64.128**.
Equivalent to the Podman `--ip` option.

### IP6=

Specify a static IPv6 address for the pod, for example **fd46:db93:aa76:ac37::10**.
Equivalent to the Podman `--ip6` option.

### Label=

Set one or more OCI labels on the pod. The format is a list of
`key=value` items, similar to `Environment`.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### Network=

Specify a custom network for the pod.
This has the same format as the `--network` option to `podman pod create`.
For example, use `host` to use the host network in the pod, or `none` to not set up networking in the pod.

Special case:

- If the `name` of the network ends with `.network`, Quadlet will look for the corresponding `.network` Quadlet unit. If found, Quadlet will use the name of the Network set in the Unit, otherwise, `systemd-$name` is used.

The generated systemd service contains a dependency on the service unit generated for that `.network` unit. Note: the corresponding `.network` file must exist.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### NetworkAlias=

Add a network-scoped alias for the pod. This has the same format as the `--network-alias` option to
`podman pod create`. Aliases can be used to group containers together in DNS resolution: for
example, setting `NetworkAlias=web` on multiple containers will make a DNS query for `web` resolve
to all the containers with that alias.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### PodmanArgs=

This key contains a list of arguments passed directly to the end of the `podman pod create` command
in the generated file. It can be used to access Podman features otherwise unsupported by the generator. Since the generator is unaware
of what unexpected interactions can be caused by these arguments, is not recommended to use
this option.

The format of this is a space separated list of arguments, which can optionally be individually
escaped to allow inclusion of whitespace and other control characters.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### PodName=

The (optional) name of the Podman pod.
If this is not specified, the default value is the same name as the unit, but with a `systemd-` prefix,
i.e. a `$name.pod` file creates a `systemd-$name` Podman pod to avoid conflicts with user-managed pods.

Please note that pods and containers cannot have the same name.
So, if PodName is set, it must not conflict with any container.

### PublishPort=

Exposes a port, or a range of ports (e.g. `50-59`), from the pod to the host. Equivalent
to the Podman `--publish` option. The format is similar to the Podman options, which is of
the form `ip:hostPort:containerPort`, `ip::containerPort`, `hostPort:containerPort` or
`containerPort`, where the number of host and container ports must be the same (in the case
of a range). The protocol can be provided at the end, e.g., `hostPort:containerPort/tcp`.
Valid protocols are `tcp` and `udp`; the `sctp` protocol is supported only for rootful containers.

If the IP is set to 0.0.0.0 or not set at all, the port is bound on all IPv4 addresses on
the host; use \[::\] for IPv6.

Note that not listing a host port means that Podman automatically selects one, and it
may be different for each invocation of service. This makes that a less useful option. The
allocated port can be found with the `podman port` command.

When using `host` networking via `Network=host`, the `PublishPort=` option cannot be used.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### ServiceName=

By default, Quadlet will name the systemd service unit by appending `-pod` to the name of the Quadlet.
Setting this key overrides this behavior by instructing Quadlet to use the provided name.

Note, the name should not include the `.service` file extension

### ShmSize=

Size of /dev/shm.

This is equivalent to the Podman `--shm-size` option and generally has the form `number[unit]`

### StopTimeout=

Sets the time in seconds to wait for the pod to gracefully stop.
This value is equivalent to the `--time` argument in the podman `pod stop` command when the service is stopped.
After this period expires, any running containers in the pod are forcibly killed.

### SubGIDMap=

Create the pod in a new user namespace using the map with name in the /etc/subgid file.
Equivalent to the Podman `--subgidname` option.

### SubUIDMap=

Create the pod in a new user namespace using the map with name in the /etc/subuid file.
Equivalent to the Podman `--subuidname` option.

### UIDMap=

Create the pod in a new user namespace using the supplied UID mapping.
Equivalent to the Podman `--uidmap` option.

This key can be listed multiple times.

### UserNS=

Set the user namespace mode for the pod. This is equivalent to the Podman `--userns` option and
generally has the form `MODE[:OPTIONS,...]`.

### Volume=

Mount a volume in the pod. This is equivalent to the Podman `--volume` option, and
generally has the form `[[SOURCE-VOLUME|HOST-DIR:]CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS]]`.

If `SOURCE-VOLUME` starts with `.`, Quadlet resolves the path relative to the location of the unit file.

Special case:

- If `SOURCE-VOLUME` ends with `.volume`, Quadlet will look for the corresponding `.volume` Quadlet unit. If found, Quadlet will use the name of the Volume set in the Unit, otherwise, `systemd-$name` is used. Note: the corresponding `.volume` file must exist.

The generated systemd service contains a dependency on the service unit generated for that `.volume` unit,
or on `$name-volume.service` if the `.volume` unit is not found.

This key can be listed multiple times.
